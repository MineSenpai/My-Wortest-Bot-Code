# My-Wortest-Bot-Code
That's my first Code for the PiratenBucht Bot. It was really worst (alle codes in one file, no structure,..). But you can use it for testing for your own Bot. 
I don't test the code for any problems. If you have a Problem with an Function and want repair it, so create a pull request. 

As high says
